Turnip patterns:

#1 Decreasing
Start price: 50-99 bells. Consistently decreases, never increases.
If price does not increase by Thursday, this is the pattern most likely.

#2 Big Spike
May start with a decreasing pattern. There will be 3 increasing prices, 
followed by 2 decreasing prices that are still higher than average, followed 
by a decreasing pattern. The max price will always be preceded by 2 increasing 
prices and followed by 2 decreasing prices.
The maximum price cannot occur on Monday or Saturday.

#3 Small Spike
May start with a decreasing pattern. There will be 4 increasing prices with the 
4th being the max price for the week. This is followed by a decreasing price that 
is higher than average. This is followed by a continuation of the decreasing pattern.
The maximum price can occur between Tuesday afternoon and Saturday morning.

#4 Random Price
Unpredictable prices in the range of about 50-200. The price seems to go over 110 at 
least twice a week.

Rules:
 - if the 2nd price is an increase, you do not have decreasing pattern
 - if the 2nd price is a decrease, you may have any of the patterns
 - if the price after the 1st increase price is a decrease, you have random pattern
    - sell if price goes over 110 bells
 - if the price after the 1st increase price is an increase, you may have big spike, 
   small spike or random
 - if the price after the 2nd increase is an increase and is >=250 bells, you probably 
   have the big spike pattern
    - sell
 - if the price after the 2nd increase is an increase and is <250 bells, you probably 
   have the small spike pattern
    - wait
 - if the price after the 2nd increase is a decrease, you have random pattern
    - sell if price goes over 110 bells
 - if the price has not increased by Thursday afternoon, you have decreasing or 
   random pattern (as this is the latest the increases required for the small spike 
   and big spike could begin)
    - sell
